# clpp

clpp is an OpenCL Data Parallel Primitives Library. 
It is a library of data-parallel algorithm primitives such as parallel-prefix-sum ("scan"), parallel sort
and parallel reduction. Primitives such as these are important building blocks for a wide variety of
data-parallel algorithms, including sorting, stream compaction, and building data structures such as
trees and summed-area tables.
